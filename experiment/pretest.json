                "a": "Height balanced binary trees by definition are those trees whose left and right subtrees have a maximum height difference of 1. A height difference of greater than 1 will make the tree unbalanced.",
                "b": "Although empty trees fall into the definition of a height balanced binary tree, they are not the only possible case for a height balanced binary tree to exist.",
                "c": "If the heights of a binary tree's subtrees differ by at least two, then the tree is termed as unbalanced height tree."

                "a": "If the height difference in the self-balancing tree becomes more than 1, then it would violate the definition of an AVL Tree.",
                "b": "A tree with only three children could be formed in any order. It might even be a skew tree. Therefore, it is not necessary that any tree with exactly three children will be an AVL Tree.",
                "c": "A self-balancing tree with height difference greater than 1 would violate the definition of an AVL tree and thus, cannot be classified as an AVL Tree.",
                "d": "AVL trees are binary search trees that are height balancing. AVL Trees assure that the height difference is not greater than 1 by checking the respective heights of right and left sub-trees."

Since N(H) which is \u2018n\u2019 can be written in terms of height as the beside recurrence relation which on solving gives N(H)= O(log n) as worst case height."
