### Search in a Red Black Tree
Search in Red Black Tree is similar to search in Binary Search Tree. Let the node to be search be X.

   - If value of X is less than root node, we traverse recursively along the left subtree.
   - If the value of X is greater than the root node, we traverse recursively along the right subtree
